My personal nix channel for things that are too sketchy or dumb to make a PR on
nixpkgs for. This is mostly just my user environment, so I don't have to fiddle
with overlays on every system I use.

You probably don't want to do this. In case you do, here's how:

```sh
nix-channel --add https://github.com/protoben/protonix/archive/master.tar.gz protonix
```
